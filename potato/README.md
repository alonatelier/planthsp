 ### The Potato: Salvation and Suffering
 
 ---
 
Woven into the history of the potato, from its Indigenous domestication in the Andes to its prevalence in diets around the world today, are the contrasting themes of comedy and tragedy, sustenance and toxicity, manna and misery. Playful and comedic interpretations of the potato abound, as seen in the cartoon by Alfred Le Petit from the 1871 collection *Fleurs, Fruits & Legumes Du Jour*. It lampoons Pierre-Frédéric Dorian, the French Minister of Public Works, by likening him to the humble and earthen tuber.  Translated into English, the text reads, “While the poet wanders in vain through the ether, Dorian acts, as everyone knows; In the reality which we find ourselves in, one can never be too much a man of the earth” (*homme de terre*). The clever wordplay of *homme de terre*/*pomme de terre* (French for potato) alludes to Dorian’s role in weapons manufacturing and policy; unlike poets, he is a grounded person of action—or so one might think. Despite his prominence in the politics of defense, Dorian refused to take a position during the popular uprisings of October 31, 1870, which likely accounts for his inclusion in this 1871 satirical publication.

In sharp contrast to the humorous irreverence of Le Petit, the realm of caricature art also yields potent depictions of the suffering and privation associated with the potato. In Honoré Daumier’s illustrations, the archetypal Irishman is shown as emaciated, ravaged by the 1845–1852 potato famine, and presented in juxtaposition to caricatures of England’s John Bull as a plump colonial oppressor.

Daumier’s work serves as a provocative interjection by another national entity, France, into the fraught space of the Britain-Ireland dialectic, presumably to reinforce and promote France and its republican, anti-monarchist ideals.[^ref1] In this way, the caricatures suggest a connection between the potato and events of transnational significance that this essay will explore.

Over the millennia, the potato has been the subject of diverse associations, meanings, and values. This multivalence is a product of societal context, and this essay will examine the perceptions and role of the potato in different societies including South America prior to European colonization, Great Britain, France, the United States, as well as through the broader lens of contemporary transnationalism. During the colonization of the Americas, the potato—along with other plants of dietary and economic value—underwent a transatlantic migration that saw its introduction to Europe. In the wake of this, attempts to integrate the potato into the fabric of European agriculture and food consumption were met with fierce resistance and debate across the social spectrum. 

These controversies saw the potato cast in terms of the perennial conflict between nature and culture. In contrast to bread, the archetypal staple food and staff of life, the potato was viewed as dangerously organic and chthonic, representative of the threat posed by disordered nature to culture and civilization.[^ref2] Well-intentioned efforts to combat food scarcity and promote the nutritional value of the potato clashed with ingrained attitudes that stigmatized the tuber as unhealthy, inferior to wheaten bread, and a danger to ordered society. Today, science seeks to ameliorate the vulnerability intrinsic to the potato—and which is largely responsible for its tragic associations—by introducing genetic material from wild relatives endemic to Latin America. That the potato has long been implicated in global movement, migration, and profound historical change speaks to the potential for plants to serve as archives in their own right.

The potato plays a significant role in the histories of famine and social inequality, poverty and migration, war and colonialism. In its native range, the potato’s singular capacity to mobilize labor enabled the consolidation of Incan imperial power; on a global scale, it helped fuel European conquest and colonialism.[^ref3] Historical tragedies such the Irish Great Famine have cemented the potato’s association with hardship and suffering in the collective imagination, a theme that persists in narratives of refugees and internment camps. These tangled social and cultural histories compel us to interrogate how one plant, taking root in different societal contexts, has come to embody such contrasting associations.

## The British Potato Debates

The potato arrived in Europe via Spanish sailors, and from the Basque provinces it spread through northern Italy, the Low Countries (including Flanders and the Southern Netherlands), Franche Comté, Alsace, and the Rhineland. Basque fishermen introduced the potato to Ireland. Generally, its diffusion followed the Spanish Road linking Spain’s territories in Northern Italy and the Low Countries. The potato’s introduction to central and northern Europe followed on the heels of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) and it was embraced by peasants who celebrated its capacity to evade military requisitioning, unlike grain.[^ref16] This potential to alleviate the threat of civilian starvation is referred to by Nally and Kearns as “survival ecology.”[^ref17] However, the potato’s association with peasants and subsistence farming became a stigma, and it emerged as a target for debates about poverty and class.

In England in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, economists and agricultural theorists were mired in what came to be known as the potato debate. The crux of the debate was the perceived juxtaposition between potatoes and grain, with ramifications for English peasants and direct relevance to the history of British colonial rule in Ireland. Some argued that potatoes came from the earth and were consumed in their natural state, unlike bread, which was the finished product of a complex process through which raw nature was transformed. Some thus considered bread to be a symbol of culture and community. In contrast, those who depended on potatoes—as was the case with the Irish—were seen as being closely bound to the soil and estranged from culture.[^ref18] In reality, English peasants consumed potatoes as well, and a 1796 guide  to their cultivation testifies to their importance in northern England, especially in Lancaster: “Potatoes are the chief maintenance of the lower classes of people here.” Despite contemporary attitudes espoused by the debates, the author went on to claim that “They are also in great estimation amongst persons of higher rank.” The author stipulated, however, that “Notwithstanding the excellent qualities peculiar to this root, the uses of it have not been well understood, nor the cultivation of it much practised in the southern counties of England.”[^ref19]  Despite its cultivation and consumption in England, disparaging the potato and those who consumed it became a convenient means of suggesting English cultural superiority over the Irish. 

Among the debaters, the potato also bore an unwelcome association with Irish Catholicism and its “ineradicability.” Like the faith of the Irish people it sustained, the tuber was able to resist destruction and maintain its “subterranean vitality.”[^ref20] In the eyes of the English, the Irish people—who ate potatoes and also believed they consumed the body of Christ in the form of the Communion wafer—were seen as embodying two extremes of backwardness: the tuber’s “degrading carnality” and the Host’s false transcendence.[^ref21] In addition, the potato’s vulnerability to disease rendered it a symbol of “biological uncertainty,” a reminder of human frailty and mortality, and by extension, the uncertainty embedded in an economy dependent upon human bodies.[^ref22]

The potato debaters rejected the earlier efforts of agricultural reformers like Arthur Young, who sought to promote acceptance of the potato and its cultivation on private allotments of land to feed the lower classes. Those who opposed Young’s Enlightenment ideals feared that his plans for its cultivation would position the potato—and those who consumed it—outside of the population-regulating apparatus of the grain economy. The potato patch was thought to encourage unchecked population growth among the lower classes and the proliferation of an unproductive labor pool.[^ref23] Young’s opponents often subscribed to a new set of capitalistic values that cast traditional subsistence practices as pernicious and slothful rather than tenacious and resourceful.[^ref24] Descriptions of the Irish peasantry from the 1770s—1830s are lurid exercises in conveying abjection and extreme poverty, though such accounts were evidently motivated by divergent goals. To support his reform agenda, Young detailed the conditions he found in the “miserable-looking hovels” he encountered during his travels in Ireland, painting a picture of smoky, windowless, and rudimentary living quarters in which humans and animals cohabitated.[^ref25]

William Cobbett, a journalist with sensationalist instincts and one of the most ardent opponents of the potato, spoke of “miserable shed[s]” and “holes” where people lived and dined, alongside their livestock, on potatoes: “nasty, filthy hog-feed.”[^ref26] Cobbett’s dehumanizing language portrays potato eaters as scarcely better than animals, living in filth and misery.
