 I want to write about the *potato*.
 I want to write about the [potato](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Patates.jpg).
 I *want* to **write** about the [potato](Q10998), so I depend on the [Wikipedia entry on potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato).  Wikipedia starts with the following sentence:

 This is the second paragraph.

 ### The Potato: Salvation and Suffering
 
 Woven into the history of the potato, from its Indigenous domestication in the Andes to its prevalence in diets around the world today, are the contrasting themes of comedy and tragedy, sustenance and toxicity, manna and misery. Playful and comedic interpretations of the potato abound, as seen in the cartoon <param ve-image

It lampoons Pierre-Frédéric Dorian, the French Minister of Public Works, by likening him to the humble and earthen tuber. Translated into English, the text reads, “While the poet wanders in vain through the ether, Dorian acts, as everyone knows; In the reality which we find ourselves in, one can never be too much a man of the earth” (homme de terre). The clever wordplay of homme de terre/pomme de terre (French for potato) alludes to Dorian’s role in weapons manufacturing and policy; unlike poets, he is a grounded person of action—or so one might think. Despite his prominence in the politics of defense, Dorian refused to take a position during the popular uprisings of October 31, 1870, which likely accounts for his inclusion in this 1871 satirical publication.
